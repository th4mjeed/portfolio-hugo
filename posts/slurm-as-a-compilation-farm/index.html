Used the existing testing server assigned to me. NFS share path located in /mnt/slrum_share Every instance has Rocky Linux 9.5 installed with ssh, root login and defined ip of all 4 nodes in the /etc/hosts file\nThe Architecture diagram for the looks like this:\nChapter 1: The installation: Install and configure dependencies Installation of slurm requires EPEL repo to be installed across all instances, install and enable it via\ndnf config-manager --set-enabled crb dnf install epel-release sudo dnf groupinstall \"Development Tools\" sudo dnf install munge munge-devel rpm-build rpmdevtools python3 gcc make openssl-devel pam-devel MUNGE is an authentication mechanism for secure communication between Slurm components. configure it on all instances using:\nsudo useradd munge sudo mkdir -p /etc/munge /var/log/munge /var/run/munge sudo chown munge:munge /usr/local/var/run/munge sudo chmod 0755 /usr/local/var/run/munge # Owner can rwx, group/others can rx (common for run dirs) On Master:\nsudo /usr/sbin/create-munge-key sudo chown munge:munge /etc/munge/munge.key sudo chmod 0400 /etc/munge/munge.key This creates a munge key with the necessary permissions, we need to copy the key to both our nodes by using scp.\nscp /etc/munge/munge.key root@node1:/etc/munge/ scp /etc/munge/munge.key root@node2:/etc/munge/ Start and Enable the service using:\nsudo systemctl enable --now munge Installation of SLURM Slurm is avaliable in the EPEL repo install on all 3 instances using:\nsudo dnf install slurm slurm-slurmd slurm-slurmctld slurm-perlapi If by any chance packages are not avaliable (Highly unlikely) you can always download tar file from Download Slurm - SchedMD extract it and use the below command to compile and install it.\nmake -j$(nproc) sudo make install Chapter 2: The Configuration: Slurm configuration On all 3 instances use the following command\nsudo useradd slurm sudo mkdir -p /etc/slurm /var/spool/slurmctld /var/spool/slurmd /var/log/slurm sudo chown slurm:slurm /var/spool/slurmctld /var/spool/slurmd /var/log/slurm This creates the user, log files and changes the ownership of the files to be slurm\nNow open the slurm config file on the master using:\nsudo nano /etc/slurm/slurm.conf The main lines to be focused on are:\nClusterName=debug\nSlurmUser=slurm\nControlMachine=slurm-master\nSlurmctldPort=6817\nSlurmdPort=6818\nAuthType=auth/munge\nStateSaveLocation=/var/spool/slurmctld\nSlurmdSpoolDir=/var/spool/slurmd\nSwitchType=switch/none\nMpiDefault=none\nSlurmctldPidFile=/var/run/slurmctld.pid\nSlurmdPidFile=/var/run/slurmd.pid\nProctrackType=proctrack/pgid\nReturnToService=1SchedulerType=sched/backfill\nSlurmctldTimeout=300\nSlurmdTimeout=30\nNodeName=node1 CPUs=4 RealMemory=3657 State=UNKNOWN\nNodeName=node2 CPUs=8 RealMemory=7682 State=UNKNOWN\nPartitionName=debug Nodes=node[1-2] Default=YES MaxTime=INFINITE State=UP\nMake sure to the values are the same as above without any spelling mistakes, also if any value is not available create them.\nCopy the same config onto node1 and node2 using\nscp /etc/slurm/slurm.conf root@node1:/etc/slurm/slurm.conf scp /etc/slurm/slurm.conf root@node2:/etc/slurm/slurm.conf Start and enable the services on boot\nOn master:\nsudo systemctl enable --now slurmctld On compute nodes:\nsudo systemctl enable --now slurmd Slurm should be working and synced up to the nodes\nFirewall Configuration: Firewall prevents ports required by slurm to be accessed, while in my testing case I had disable the firewall service, I would not recommend doing this in production, hence the correct way to open ports in slurm, on all 3 instances:\nsudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6817/tcp sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6818/tcp sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=6819/tcp sudo firewall-cmd --reload Chapter 3: Testing and Introduction to the commands: [While this is a short guide on the commands and its flags, you could always use man pages to understand it more deeply]\nsinfo: This command is displays the information about the nodes, what the partition name is, on what state they’re in and how many nodes are included in the partition\n[root@master ~]# sinfo PARTITION AVAIL TIMELIMIT NODES STATE NODELIST debug* up infinite 2 idle node[1-2] Idle here means that the nodes are waiting for a job to be assigned.\nsrun: srun is used to run command on the compute nodes via master in an interactive manner. For example if I needed to know the cores available in node 1 and 2\n[root@master ~]# srun -N2 -n2 nproc 4 8 Where the -N is the number of nodes for the job (here nproc) to be allocated, and -n is the number of tasks to be given to the node.\nsbatch : Used to submit a job script which is provided as an argument to the file. For example\n[root@master ~]# sbatch [testjob.sh](http://testjob.sh/) Submitted batch job 1 We’ll be learning more about the syntax of these files later\nsqueue: Used to display details of currently running jobs, such as on what node is it running, user and how long has it has been running.\n[root@master ~]# squeue JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME NODES NODELIST(REASON) 1 debug test_job root R 0:02 1 node1 Here we can see the job we previously executed job via sbatch\nscancel: Used to cancel a submitted job, this command does not explicitly return an output.\n[root@master ~]# scancel 1 [root@master ~]# squeue JOBID PARTITION NAME USER ST TIME NODES NODELIST(REASON) [root@master ~]# scontrol : Provides a detailed information about the nodes the usage of this command is a little vast some common example are:\n[root@master ~]# scontrol show job 1 JobId=1 JobName=test_job UserId=root(0) GroupId=root(0) MCS_label=N/A Priority=4294901750 Nice=0 Account=(null) QOS=normal JobState=RUNNING Reason=None Dependency=(null) Requeue=1 Restarts=0 BatchFlag=1 Reboot=0 ExitCode=0:0 RunTime=00:00:04 TimeLimit=00:01:00 TimeMin=N/A SubmitTime=2025-05-19T02:34:05 EligibleTime=2025-05-19T02:34:05 AccrueTime=2025-05-19T02:34:05 StartTime=2025-05-19T02:34:05 EndTime=2025-05-19T02:35:05 Deadline=N/A SuspendTime=None SecsPreSuspend=0 LastSchedEval=2025-05-19T02:34:05 Scheduler=Backfill Partition=debug AllocNode:Sid=master:20850 ReqNodeList=(null) ExcNodeList=(null) NodeList=node1 BatchHost=node1 NumNodes=1 NumCPUs=1 NumTasks=1 CPUs/Task=1 ReqB:S:C:T=0:0:*:* TRES=cpu=1,node=1,billing=1 Socks/Node=* NtasksPerN:B:S:C=0:0:*:* CoreSpec=* MinCPUsNode=1 MinMemoryNode=0 MinTmpDiskNode=0 Features=(null) DelayBoot=00:00:00 OverSubscribe=OK Contiguous=0 Licenses=(null) Network=(null) Command=/root/testjob.sh WorkDir=/root StdErr=/root/slurm_test_output.txt StdIn=/dev/null StdOut=/root/slurm_test_output.txt Power= 6.1 scontrol show job 1: Displays details of the running job\n[root@master ~]# scontrol show partition PartitionName=debug AllowGroups=ALL AllowAccounts=ALL AllowQos=ALL AllocNodes=ALL Default=YES QoS=N/A DefaultTime=NONE DisableRootJobs=NO ExclusiveUser=NO GraceTime=0 Hidden=NO MaxNodes=UNLIMITED MaxTime=UNLIMITED MinNodes=0 LLN=NO MaxCPUsPerNode=UNLIMITED Nodes=node[1-2] PriorityJobFactor=1 PriorityTier=1 RootOnly=NO ReqResv=NO OverSubscribe=NO OverTimeLimit=NONE PreemptMode=OFF State=UP TotalCPUs=12 TotalNodes=2 SelectTypeParameters=NONE JobDefaults=(null) DefMemPerNode=UNLIMITED MaxMemPerNode=UNLIMITED TRES=cpu=12,mem=11339M,node=2,billing=12 6.2 scontrol show partition: Displays information about the partitions (here referring to the node config).\n6.3 scontrol cancel jobid=: Another way to cancel jobs\n6.4 scontrol requeue : Requeues the an errored out job\n6.5 scontrol update jobid= priority=100000: Increases the priority of a running job\n6.6 scontrol update NodeName=node01 State=RESUME: Resume a drained or a disabled node\nChapter 4: Setting up the NFS storage. It is a good idea to have a shared storage on slurm, since you may run into issues like not having enough space, or when you want both the nodes accessing a same file or folder. We’ll be using nfs-utils package to achieve this, install on NFS device and\nsudo dnf install nfs-utils On the Linux machine to be used as NFS (here testing-server)\nCreating a directory in /srv/slrum_share using:\nmkdir /srv/slurm_share Open the file /etc/exports in nano and add the following line\nnano /etc/exports /srv/slurm_share 10.10.40.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)\nSave and quit the file.\nOpen Ports using:\nfirewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=rpc-bind firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port={5555/tcp,5555/udp,6666/tcp,6666/udp} firewall-cmd --reload Export the share and enable the server using the following command:\nexportfs -v systemctl enable —now nfs-server On the master and compute nodes:\nCreate a directory in /mnt/slurm_share using:\nsudo mkdir /mnt/slurm_share To the mount the share on boot open the following file in nano with /etc/nano and paste the line:\n/mnt/slurm_share 10.10.40.0/24(rw,sync,no_subtree_check,no_root_squash)\nReboot the machines and you should have the shared folder mounted to /mnt/slurm_share\nChapter 5: Setting up the Compile/Build Environment There are certain development dependencies that are required to build the kernel, these need to be installed on all the nodes including the master, use this command to parallelly install them:\nsrun -n2 -N2 sudo dnf groupinstall \"Development Tools\" -y \u0026\u0026 sudo dnf install ncurses-devel bison flex elfutils-libelf-devel openssl-devel wget bc dwarves -y This will install them in on the nodes and the same command without srun -n2 -N2 to install on master.\nDownload the Linux kernel source from kernel.org as for writing this the latest stable kernel version is 6.14.8. Download this tar and extract on the shared folder using.\nwget [https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.14.8.tar.xz](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v6.x/linux-6.14.8.tar.xz) tar xvf linux-6.14.8.tar.xz Use the below command to define an architecture specific .config file\nmake defconfig On master:\ncreate a file named compile_kernel.sh on the share mounted directory and paste the code in it:\n#!/bin/bash # # SLURM Batch Script for Kernel Compilation # #SBATCH --job-name=kernel_build # Name of your job #SBATCH --output=kernel_build_%j.out # Standard output file (%j expands to jobID) #SBATCH --error=kernel_build_%j.err # Standard error file #SBATCH --time=03:00:00 # Max runtime (3 hours, adjust as needed) #SBATCH --nodes=1 # Request 1 compute node # # --- RESOURCE REQUESTS (CHOOSE ONE SET) --- # # Option A: For node1 (4 cores, 4GB RAM) # #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=4 # Request 4 CPU cores for make -j4 # #SBATCH --mem=4G # Request 4GB RAM # # Option B: For node2 (8 cores, 8GB RAM) - RECOMMENDED FOR FASTER BUILDS #SBATCH --cpus-per-task=8 # Request 8 CPU cores for make -j8 #SBATCH --mem=8G # Request 8GB RAM # # --- END RESOURCE REQUESTS --- # Set environment variables for the kernel build # Replace 'linux-6.x.y' with your actual kernel source directory name KERNEL_SOURCE_PATH=\"/mnt/slurm_share/linux-6.8.9\" BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR=\"/mnt/slurm_share/kernel_builds/${SLURM_JOB_ID}\" echo \"-----------------------------------------------------\" echo \"SLURM Job ID: ${SLURM_JOB_ID}\" echo \"Job Name: ${SLURM_JOB_NAME}\" echo \"Running on host: $(hostname)\" echo \"Assigned CPUS: ${SLURM_CPUS_PER_TASK}\" echo \"Assigned Memory: ${SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE}MB\" # Note: SLURM_MEM_PER_NODE is in MB if --mem was in GB echo \"Kernel Source Path: ${KERNEL_SOURCE_PATH}\" echo \"Build Output Dir: ${BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR}\" echo \"Current working directory: $(pwd)\" echo \"-----------------------------------------------------\" # Create a unique directory for the build output (artifacts) mkdir -p \"$BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR\" if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo \"ERROR: Could not create output directory $BUILD_OUTPUT_DIR\" exit 1 fi # Change to the kernel source directory cd \"$KERNEL_SOURCE_PATH\" if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then echo \"ERROR: Could not change to kernel source directory $KERNEL_SOURCE_PATH\" exit 1 fi # Load any necessary modules (e.g., specific GCC versions, cross-compilers) # module load gcc/12.2.0 # module load some-toolchain # Set the number of parallel jobs for 'make'. # This uses the number of CPUs SLURM allocated to your job.
